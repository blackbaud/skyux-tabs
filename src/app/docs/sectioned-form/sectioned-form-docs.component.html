          Use sectioned forms when users are navigating into a hierarchy and can be expected to know what they are looking for. This is common for editing pieces of a larger record and for tasks such as applying filter
        </p>
        <p class="sky-docs-text-block">
          Use sectioned forms when it’s beneficial to group related but independent forms to simplify the UI on the page. For example, one “Add filters” button instead of “Filter by giving,” “Filter by status,” “Filter by constituent code,” “Filter by ratings,” etc.

          Don't use sectioned forms when choices on one tab can affect other tabs because changes are potentially invisible or unpredictable to users.
