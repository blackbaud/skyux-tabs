          Use sectioned forms when users navigate into a hierarchy and you expect them to know what they are looking for. This is common for editing pieces of a larger record and for tasks such as applying filters.
        </p>
        <p class="sky-docs-text-block">
          Use sectioned forms when itâ€™s beneficial to group related but independent forms to simplify the UI on the page. For example, use an Add filters button to open a sectioned form with multiple filter options instead of separate buttons and separate forms to access options to filter by giving, status, constituent code, ratings, or other options.

          Don't use sectioned forms when choices on one tab can affect other tabs because changes are potentially invisible or unpredictable to users.
